# Third-Party-APIs-Challenge

## Description
This project is to build a Work Day Scheduler application. The application will display time blocks (9AM to 5PM) for that day and each time block will be color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.

### Usage
To use this application, go to [GitHub Pages] and click on the time block where you have an event. Type the event and click on the blue save button.
<br>**NOTE:** Please make sure to click on the save button to save your schedule. Otherwise, it will disappear once the page is refreshed.
